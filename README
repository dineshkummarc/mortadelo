Mortadelo - a viewer for system calls
=====================================

This is Mortadelo, a viewer for system calls that are related to the
file system.  You can think of it as a "systemwide strace":  Mortadelo
uses Systemtap to monitor all running processes.  Mortadelo does not
monitor all the system calls that strace supports; just the ones to
which you pass a filename.  This is generally enough to diagnose
simple problems (an program crashes because it can't find a file), or
to get hints as to where performance problems may lie (who's hammering
my hard drive?).

* Please read the HACKING file if you intend to hack on Mortadelo, and
  read doc/architecture.txt for an overview of the code.


What's in a name?
-----------------

Mortadelo started life as a clone of Filemon, a proprietary Windows
utility to monitor system calls related to the file system
(http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/FileAndDisk/Filemon.mspx).

Requirements
------------

A Linux kernel, version 2.6.16 or later.  Mortadelo may also work on
slightly older versions.

Systemtap (http://sources.redhat.com/systemtap/) corresponding to your
kernel.  Note that Systemtap requires a kernel with debug information,
so you may need to install "debuginfo" packages or however your
distribution decides to call them.

Mono (http://mono-project.com) and gtk-sharp.  Mortadelo was developed
with Mono 1.2.2 and gtk-sharp 2.8.3.
