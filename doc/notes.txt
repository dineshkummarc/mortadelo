+ Add license.

+ SyscallInserted

	- In log.cs, make it use SyscallInserted instead of
	  SyscallAdded

	- Change the tests

	- Add SyscallInserted to filtered-log.cs.

- SyscallRemoved

	- Make filtered-log.cs emit SyscallRemoved when a row gets
	un-filtered.

	- Add a test for this (change a result from "?" to "1" and
	have a filter for "?" - the row should disappear).

+ Basic functionality:
	- log open() calls
	- saving
	- loading
	- compact view
	- Check for root at startup
	- highlight errors
	+ "jump to the next error" command
	+ filtering

- String.Intern() instead of my own StringPool.

+ Native.Stdlib.strerror() instead of errno.cs

+ GUI polish:

	+ When a row is selected in Full View mode:

		+ Unhighlight the old paired row

		+ Highlight the new paired row

	+ Human-readable timestamps (right now we just display usecs after the epoch).

+ Future:

	+ Pluggable syscalls.  Have a SyscallCombo class which provides a parser, serializer, 
	  aggregator for a single type of syscall.  Implement Open() in terms of this.
