- Log:

	- Array of syscalls

- Parser:

	- Parse a line of text into a Syscall

- Driver:

	- Read a line

	- MemoryStream to turn a byte[] into a Stream, then StreamReader to turn the Stream into a TextReader,
	  then feed the TextReader into our LineReader.

	- Parse the line

	- Feed Syscall to the Log

- GUI:

	+ Every second, update from the log.

+ Basic functionality:
	- log open() calls
	- saving
	+ loading
	+ filtering
	+ highlight errors

- Reducing memory consumption:

	- Write a big log directly from systemtap

	- "make memory-profile"

	- Load the log

	- Use a pool of shared strings in the Log.
