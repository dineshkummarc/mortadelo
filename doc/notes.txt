+ Kill the child process when we get SIGTERM.

+ Add license.

- Make "Displayed syscalls: N" be related to the filtered log.

- Make filtering faster:

	- Memoize the regex matches.

	- Discard the memoization when the regex changes.

	+ Start a timer when the entry changes, and reset it every
	  time the entry changes again.  If the entry doesn't change and
	  the timeout expires, actually perform the re-filtering.

- Catch regex compilation errors; print the exception text in the
  status bar.

- Do automatic regex casefolding like Emacs.  If the typed string is lowercase,
  do a case-insensitive match.  If the typed string has uppercase
  chars, do a case-sensitive match.

+ Basic functionality:
	- log open() calls
	- saving
	- loading
	- compact view
	- Check for root at startup
	- highlight errors
	+ "jump to the next error" command
	- filtering

- String.Intern() instead of my own StringPool.

+ Native.Stdlib.strerror() instead of errno.cs

+ GUI polish:

	+ When a row is selected in Full View mode:

		+ Unhighlight the old paired row

		+ Highlight the new paired row

	- Human-readable timestamps (right now we just display usecs
	  after the epoch).

	+ "Show errors only"

+ Future:

	+ Pluggable syscalls.  Have a SyscallCombo class which provides a parser, serializer, 
	  aggregator for a single type of syscall.  Implement Open() in terms of this.
