+ Basic functionality:
	- log open() calls
	- saving
	- loading
	- compact view
	- Check for root at startup
	- highlight errors
	+ "jump to the next error" command
	+ filtering

+ GUI polish:

	+ When a row is selected in Full View mode:

		+ Unhighlight the old paired row

		+ Highlight the new paired row

	+ Human-readable timestamps (right now we just display usecs after the epoch).

+ Future:

	+ Pluggable syscalls.  Have a SyscallCombo class which provides a parser, serializer, 
	  aggregator for a single type of syscall.  Implement Open() in terms of this.
