Mortadelo 0.2
=============

This is the first public release of Mortadelo, a viewer for system
calls that are related to the file system.  You can think of it as a
"systemwide strace".

* Features:

	- Monitoring of system calls related to the file system.

	- Support for loading/saving of the system call logs.

	- Compact view (like a normal strace), or full view, with both
          start and stop times for each system call.

	- Highlighting of the start/stop times for the selected sytem
          call, for easy identification.

	- Highlighting of system calls with error results.
